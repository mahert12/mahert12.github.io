              Hi!  My name is <span class='emph'>Tim</span> and I'm a <span class='emph'>software developer</span>.  I primarily work on websites, but you can find out all about my work and projects below.
              </br></br>
              Outside of work I have quite a few hobbies.  My favorite is <span class='emph'>snowboarding</span>, but due to Maryland's climate I can't spend as much time on that as I would like.  When I'm not writing code or snowboarding I try to <span class='emph'>learn</span> as much as I can about as much as I can.  I love watching recordings of lectures or trying out online tutorials.
              </br></br>
              Like most software developers I also play games (digital and physical).  But more than just playing, I also love the <span class='emph'>study of games</span>, the study of 'play' in general, and looking at ways that that can be applied to other disiplines.
            </p>

              <h4>Enterprise Business Partners</h4>
              I will be joining the team at <a href='https://www.enterprisecommunity.org/' class='a-purple'>Enterprise</a> as of May 6, 2019.  I'm very excited for this new opportunity to learn and grow.
            </p>

            <p class='vertical-center'>
              <h4>ApplicationsOnline</h4>
              I started at <a href='http://applicationsonline.com/' class='a-purple'>ApplicationsOnline</a> in <span class='emph'>April 2017</span>, then shortly became a full time employee in March that same year.  I left on good terms in April 2019.
              </br></br>
              I worked at least a small ammount on each project available at ApplicationsOnline, but spend most of my time <span class='emph'>improving</span> the <a href='https://applywithus.com/' class='a-purple'>ApplyWithUs platform</a> which includes <a href='https://gatewaytoprepschools.com/' class='a-purple'>Gateway to Prep Schools</a> and <a href='https://universalcollegeapp.com/' class='a-purple'>The Universal College Application</a>.  I've also spent a large amount of time working on and <span class='emph'>launching</span> the <a href='https://awu-cmp.com/' class='a-purple'>CMP platform</a>.
              </br></br>
              At ApplicationsOnline I took on a <span class='emph'>leadership role</span> within the software development team and I frequently <span class='emph'>communicated with clients</span> directly in addition to my software development tasks.
            </p>

            <p class='vertical-center'>
              <h4>UMBC</h4>
              I studied at UMBC for <span class='emph'>5 years</span> learning computer science with a focus on game design.
              </br></br>
              Some of my favorite courses include <span class='emph'>Ethics</span> for the interesting research papers I wrote, <span class='emph'>Computer Vision</span> for introducing me to machine learning, and <span class='emph'>History and Theory of Game Design</span> for being one of my passions.  I'm always happy to talk about any of my courses, but these 3 even more so.
              </br></br>
              I very much enjoyed my time there and it's even where I met my fianc√©e.  In addition to my studies at UMBC, I managed the Friday Night LANs club for 2 years.
