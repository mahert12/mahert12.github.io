              Hi!  My name is <span class='emph'>Tim</span> and I'm a <span class='emph'>software developer</span>.  I primarily work on websites, but you can find out all about my work and projects below.
              </br></br>
              Outside of work I have quite a few hobbies.  My favorite is <span class='emph'>snowboarding</span>, but due to Maryland's climate I can't spend as much time on that as I would like.  When I'm not writing code or snowboarding I try to <span class='emph'>learn</span> as much as I can about as much as I can.  I love watching recordings of lectures or trying out online tutorials.
              </br></br>
              Like most software developers I also play games (digital and physical).  But more than just playing, I also love the <span class='emph'>study of games</span>, the study of 'play' in general, and looking at ways that that can be applied to other disiplines.
            </p>

            <h4>ApplicationsOnline</h4>
            <p>
              I currently work here.  I started at <a href='http://applicationsonline.com/' class='a-gunmetal'>ApplicationsOnline</a> in <span class='emph'>April 2017</span>, then shortly became a full time employee in March that same year.
              </br></br>
              I've worked a little bit on every project ApplicationsOnline has, but spend most of my time <span class='emph'>improving</span> the <a href='https://applywithus.com/' class='a-gunmetal'>ApplyWithUs platform</a> which includes <a href='https://gatewaytoprepschools.com/' class='a-gunmetal'>Gateway to Prep Schools</a> and <a href='https://universalcollegeapp.com/' class='a-gunmetal'>The Universal College Application</a>.  I've also spent a large amount of time working on and <span class='emph'>launching</span> the <a href='https://awu-cmp.com/' class='a-gunmetal'>CMP platform</a>.
              </br></br>
              At ApplicationsOnline I have taken on a <span class='emph'>leadership role</span> within the software development team and I frequently <span class='emph'>communicate with clients</span> in addition to my software development tasks.
            </p>

            <h4>UMBC</h4>
            <p>
              I studied at UMBC for <span class='emph'>5 years</span> learning computer science with a focus on game design.
              </br></br>
              Some of my favorite courses include <span class='emph'>Ethics</span> for the interesting research papers I wrote, <span class='emph'>Computer Vision</span> for introducing me to machine learning, and <span class='emph'>History and Theory of Game Design</span> for being one of my passions.  I'm always happy to talk about any of my courses, but these 3 even more so.
              </br></br>
              I very much enjoyed my time there and its even where I met my fianc√©e.  In addition to my studies at UMBC, I managed the Friday Night LANs club for 2 years.
