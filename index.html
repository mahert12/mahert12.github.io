        <h3>About Me</h3>
      </header>

      <p>
        Hi!  My name is Tim and I'm a software developer.  I primarily work on websites, but you can find out all about my work and projects below.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of work I have quite a few hobbies.  My favorite is snowboarding, but due to Maryland's climate I can't spend as much time on that as I would like.  When I'm not writing code or snowboarding I try to learn as much as I can about as much as I can.  I love watching recordings of lectures or trying out online tutorials.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like most software developers I also play games (digital and physical).  But more than just playing, I also love the study of games, the study of 'play' in general, and looking at ways that that can be applied to other disiplines.

        <h3>Experiences / Past Projects</h3>
      </header>

      <h4>ApplicationsOnline</h4>
      <p>
        I currently work here.  I started at <a href='http://applicationsonline.com/'>ApplicationsOnline</a> in April of 2017, then shortly became a full time employee in March that same year.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've worked a little bit on every project ApplicationsOnline has, but spend most of my time improving the <a href='https://applywithus.com/'>ApplyWithUs platform</a> which includes <a href='https://gatewaytoprepschools.com/'>Gateway to Prep Schools</a> and <a href='https://universalcollegeapp.com/'>The Universal College Application</a>.  I've also spent a large amount of time working on and launching the <a href='https://awu-cmp.com/'>CMP platform</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        At ApplicationsOnline I have taken on a leadership role within the software development team and I frequently communicate with clients in addition to my software development tasks.
      </p>

      <h4>UMBC</h4>
      <p>
        I studied at UMBC for 5 years learning computer science with a focus on game design.  Some of my favorite courses include <span class='course'>Ethics in Computer Science</span>, <span class='course'>Special Topics in Computer Science: Computer Vision</span>, and <span class='course'>History and Theory of Game Design</span>.  I'm always happy to talk about these 3 courses, and many others.  I very much enjoyed my time there and its even where I met my fianc√©e.  In addition to my studies at UMBC, I managed the Friday Night LANs club for 2 years.
