      <p>
        Hi!  My name is Tim and I'm a software developer.
        I primarily work on websites, but you can find out all about my work and projects below.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of work I have quite a few hobbies.
        My favorite is snowboarding, but due to Maryland's climate I can't spend as much time on that as I would like.
        When I'm not writing code or snowboarding I try to learn as much as I can about as much as I can.
        I love watching recordings of lectures or trying out online tutorials.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like most software developers I also play games (digital and physical).
        But more than just playiny, I also love the study of games, the study of 'play' in general, and looking at ways that that can be applied to other disiplines.
